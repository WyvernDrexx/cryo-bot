# Cryo Discord Bot

To get started run the following command:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/WyvernDrexx/cryo-bot.git

```

After doing that setup `config.json` to have the following contents:

```json

{
	"BOT_TOKEN": ""
}

```

You need the `BOT_TOKEN` that is avilable from Discord Developer panel.

Now, just run `npm start`, the bot should be online now.
